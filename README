Vim script for enhancing the built-in marks functionality of vim. 

It gives you a chance to associate some meaningful annotation with a particular mark,
thus decreases the possibility of you getting lost amongst a large amount of codes.
Also, it keeps track of which marks to use automatically: you don't have specify the
name of mark. It uses global marks (A-Z) and tries to use an empty mark when possible.
The first mark you add would be A, next would be B, etc. If all marks are used, it'll
search for an least used one (provided that you use THIS script for jumping to it) and
overwrite it.
The information about marks are persistent so restarting Vim won't affect them.

Usage:
Pretty straight forward stuff.
After installation (drop it in $RUNTIME/plugin), <Leader>M will add a new mark. You'll
be prompted for a comment on this mark.
:Amarks would list all marks known to this script and let you choose one to jump to.

Configuration:
g:am_persistent_file. String. Defines the file that this script writes to between vim sessions.
g:am_use_popup_menu. 1 or 0. If it's 1, popup menu would be used, otherwise, echo would be used.
